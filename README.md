# 🚀 Welcome to TodoPath: Where Tasks Meet Their Match

## 🌟 What's This All About?

Hey there, productivity warrior! 👋 Welcome to TodoPath, your new best friend in the battle against chaos and procrastination! This isn't just another todo app - it's a task-crushing powerhouse built with Ruby on Rails (because we're fancy on the backend) and React Native (because we want you to look good on any device). Think of it as your personal task bodyguard, keeping your projects organized and your life in check!

## ✨ Features That'll Make You Go "Wow!"

- 🔐 **User Authentication** - Because we don't want just anyone peeking at your master plan for world domination
- ✏️ **CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks (or as we like to call it, "The Circle of Task Life")
- 📁 **Project Organization** - Group your tasks like a pro! Marie Kondo would be proud
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Looks gorgeous whether you're on a phone, tablet, or quantum computer
- 🌍 **Cross-Platform** - Works on iOS and Android because we don't discriminate against operating systems

## 🛠️ Prerequisites (The Stuff You Need)

Before we embark on this exciting journey, make sure you've got:

- 💎 Ruby (v2.7+) - The shinier, the better!
- 🛤️ Rails (v6.0+) - All aboard the Rails express!
- 📦 Node.js (v12+) - Because JavaScript makes the world go round
- 🧶 Yarn - Not the knitting kind, unfortunately
- 📱 React Native CLI - Your command line companion
- 🤖 Android Studio - For Android wizardry
- 🍎 Xcode - For iOS magic (Mac users only, sorry Windows friends!)

## 🚀 Setup (Let's Get This Party Started!)

### 1. Clone the Repository (Get the Code!)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garyforce/task-list
cd task-list
```

### 2. Backend Setup (The Brain of the Operation)

```bash
cd Backend
bundle install        # Installing the gems (not the shiny ones)
rails db:create      # Creating your database palace
rails db:migrate     # Setting up the furniture
rails db:seed       # Planting some sample data seeds
rails server        # Start the party! 🎉
```

### 3. Frontend Setup (The Pretty Face)

```bash
cd Frontend
yarn install         # Getting all the JavaScript goodies
yarn start          # Fire up the engines! 🔥
```

### 4. Running on Android (For the Robot Fans)

```bash
yarn android        # Make sure your emulator is doing jumping jacks
```

### 5. Running on iOS (For the Apple Enthusiasts)

```bash
yarn ios            # Your simulator should be warmed up and ready!
```

## 🎮 How to Use This Bad Boy

2. Sign up or log in (we promise not to ask for your life story)
3. Create a project (maybe "World Domination"?)
4. Add some tasks (like "Buy cat food" or "Learn to juggle")
